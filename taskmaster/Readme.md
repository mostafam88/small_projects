# Taskmaster

The Taskmaster has twelve seemingly identical marbles which are identified with
numbers 1 to 12. One of these marbles has different weight from the rest. Only
the Taskmaster knows which one it is. The Taskmaster may be queried to compare
the weight of two sets of marbles. This can only be done for maximum three
times. Afterwards, one should give their answer for the id of marble with
different weight.
