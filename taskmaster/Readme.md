# Taskmaster

The Taskmaster has twelve seemingly identical marbles which are identified with
numbers 1 to 12. One of these marbles has a slightly different weight from the
rest, i.e. it might be slightly heavier or lighter. Only the Taskmaster knows
which one it is. The Taskmaster may be queried to compare the weight of two sets
of marbles. This can only be done for maximum three times. Afterwards, one
should give their answer for the id of marble with different weight.
